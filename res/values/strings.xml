        Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace (10 December 1815 – 27 November 1852), 
        born Augusta Ada Byron and now commonly known as Ada Lovelace, was an English 
        mathematician and writer chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage\'s early 
        mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. Her notes on the 
        engine include what is recognised as the first algorithm intended to be carried 
        out by a machine. Because of this, she is often described as the world\'s first 
        computer programmer.

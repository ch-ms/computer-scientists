        Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace (10 December 1815 – 27 November 1852), 
        born Augusta Ada Byron and now commonly known as Ada Lovelace, was an English 
        mathematician and writer chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage\'s early 
        mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. Her notes on the 
        engine include what is recognised as the first algorithm intended to be carried 
        out by a machine. Because of this, she is often described as the world\'s first 
        computer programmer.

        Alan Mathison Turing, OBE, FRS (/ˈtjʊərɪŋ/ tewr-ing; 23 June 1912 – 7 June 1954) 
        was a British mathematician, logician, cryptanalyst and computer scientist. He was 
        highly influential in the development of computer science, giving a formalisation 
        of the concepts of "algorithm" and "computation" with the Turing machine, which can 
        be considered a model of a general purpose computer.[2][3][4] Turing is widely 
        considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial 
        intelligence.
